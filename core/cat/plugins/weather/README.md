## How to use it

To initiate Cheshire Cat's Google search functionality, we recommend using the formula **"search on Google for"** followed by your desired search query. Keep in mind that search results may differ based on various IP locations due to Google's strong reliance on geolocation for its Search Engine Results Page (SERP).
